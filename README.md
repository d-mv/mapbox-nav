# Mapbox Navigation Element

## What is this?

Step-by-step navigation element, used in [Chaserz project](https://github.com/d-mv/chaserz). Work in progress.

## How it works?

Draws a route form point A to point B. Shows instructions (disabled by default), you position along the way.

## TODO

- Update instructions based on location
- Build the route with multiple checkpoints
- Move the map along, based on my position
